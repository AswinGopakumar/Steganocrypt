# Steganocrypt

Steganocrypt is a combination of LSB-Steganography as well as AES encryption along with DNA encoding. In this project we first encoded the plaintext to its corresponding DNA bases and then compressed the result using g-zip and converted it to a ciphertext using AES-256 encryption technology.
## Note
The key will be generated to a USB-drive which will then be required for decrypting the message
